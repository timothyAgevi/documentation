# Getting Started with Apibara

Apibara is the easiest way to build production-grade indexers:

- **Stream** onchain data into your indexer, receiving exactly the data you need.
- **Transform** the data into a higher-level representation that maps to your application domain.
- **Integrate** data with the rest of your application by sending it to other services.

```
                                Transform
┌──────────────┐             ┌──────────────┐              ┌──────────────┐
│              │░            │              │░             │              │░

```

This page will guide you in setting up your development environment for Apibara
and writing your first indexer.

## Install the CLI tool

Install the `apibara` CLI by running the following command. Note that you need
`jq` install for this to work. Alternatively, you can download the CLI from our
[release page](https://github.com/apibara/dna/releases) and manually add it to
your `$PATH`.

```bash [Terminal]
curl -sL https://install.apibara.com | bash
```

After this, create a new terminal and check that `apibara` is installed:

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
apibara --version
```

```
apibara-cli 0.4.0
```

:::

If the command above prints `apibara: command not found` it means that the
Apibara directory is not in `$PATH`. To fix it, make sure that the Apibara
directory is in `$PATH`, the directory is system-dependent and is printed during
the installation phase.

## Managing plugins

Apibara doesn't include any integration out of the box. Integrations are a
special type of plugin and are managed using the CLI.

List the installed plugins using the following command. Note that, as expected,
no plugin is installed.

```bash [Terminal]
apibara plugins list
```

We use the `apibara plugins install` command to download and install plugins
from GitHub.

For this tutorial, we install the "console" plugin since it requires no external dependency or service.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
apibara plugins install sink-console
```

```
Found release Console Sink v0.1.0
Downloading sink-console-x86_64-linux.gz...
Plugin console installed to /home/user/.local/share/apibara/plugins/apibara-sink-console
```

:::

Now we can list the plugins again to check that the plugin was installed correctly.

:::cli-command

```bash [Terminal]
apibara plugins list
```

```
╭─────────┬──────┬─────────╮
│ NAME    │ KIND │ VERSION │
├─────────┼──────┼─────────┤
│ console │ sink │ 0.4.1   │
╰─────────┴──────┴─────────╯
```

## Creating an Apibara account and API Key

Head over to the [registration page](https://app.apibara.com/auth/register) to
create an Apibara account.

![Registration page](register.png)

From your dashboard, click on the "New Indexer" button and then select "DNA Key".
Choose a memorable name for your API Key and then click "Deploy Indexer".

![Create API Key](create-api-key.png)

Finally, copy the API Key to your clipboard. Notice that you can come back to this
page at any time from your dashboard.

![Copy API Key](copy-api-key.png)

As we will see in the next section, you will need the API Key to authenticate
with the data streams hosted by Apibara.

## Your first indexer

Indexers are implemented as Javascript or Typescript scripts.
Scripts need to export at least two things:

- a `config` object that contains the indexer configuration.
- a default function, used to transform each batch of data streamed by Apibara.

A minimal script looks like the following:

```js [script.js]
export const config = {
  streamUrl: "https://sepolia.starknet.a5a.ch",
  startingBlock: 10_000,
  network: "starknet",
  finality: "DATA_STATUS_ACCEPTED",
  filter: {
    header: {},
  },
  sinkType: "console",
  sinkOptions: {},
};

// This transform does nothing.
export default function transform(block) {
  return block;
}
```

You can run it using the `apibara run` command. Notice that you need a free API
key from Apibara to consume the hosted stream.

```bash [Terminal]
apibara run script.js -A  dna_xxx
```

The indexer script is a self-contained script that is used by Apibara to
configure and transform the data stream. If you try to run the script directly
using, for example, Node.js or Bun it will not do anything.
